                During a breeder auction, koi are not yet in the United States
                and are still in Japan. Koi that are won are then shipped to the
                United States, quarantined for 4+ weeks by regulation, and
                shipped via Delta Cargo to the buyer. The buyer is responsible
                for all shipping and handling fees which are invoiced post
                auction. We will contact you via phone or email to arrange a
                preferred shipping time, location, and payment.

                When you win a koi, we'll reach out to you to schedule a

                Shipping costs vary depending on the size of the koi and the
                type of auction you are participating in. A deposit will be
                charged per koi won at the end of each auction to cover the cost
                of shipping which varies from shipment to shipment. The deposit
                amount will be $250 for Japanese Breeder auctions and $130 for
                In-House auctions. Shipping costs are assessed post-auction and
